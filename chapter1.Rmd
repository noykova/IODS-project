# Introduction to Open Data Science

This course is a brief introduction to data science - what to do with the big amount of data, how to model them and extract important information, which could be used later on for analyses and predictions. 
The course will teach us how to use GitHUb (system for version control) to share results. The modeling of data will be performed using R. 

##1. Tools and methods for open and reproducible research

First step is to learn basic GitHub commands as fork, copy, commit. We have to make our first steps in R as well. The goal of creating this document is to learn how to create markdown documents and share them on the net using GitHub.
